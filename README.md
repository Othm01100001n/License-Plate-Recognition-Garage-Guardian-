## About Project
Let's say you own a big company with a very large parking lot (presumably), and you want to know exactly which employee's cars entered and which went out. 
First thing that should come to mind is using a *camera* to detect these cars going through the gate, or you could choose the intellectual option, ehm... and purchase a License
Plate detection Camera, which is unironically the best possible solution for this problem.

                                    
Now, machine learning in python has allowed me to make a device that can sense when a car is near, and turn on the camera, which processes the image taken(of the
vehicle) and sends an email to the client with the taken image of the car, a text with the license plate number, and a cropped image of the license plate. 


## Material
- Raspberry PI 
- PI-Camera(or any good quality camera)
- Python 3.7.2
- a good old breadbord
- Ultra-sonic sensor
- Jumper Wires
- One 1.5k ohm Resistor
- One 1k ohm Resistor                
                  
## Installation
- Download and install python from the official website, preferablly python 3.7 or later https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
