AUTOMATIC LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION USING PYTHON!

Abstract:
        ->
   Let's say you own a big company with a very large parking lot (presumably), and you want to know exactly which employee's cars entered and which went out. 
First thing that should come to mind is using a camera to detect these cars going through the gate, or you could go the extra mile and purchase a License
Plate detection Camera, which is unironically the best possible solution and smarter and the most intellectual... ehm...
                                    
  Now, machine learning in python has allowed me to make a device that can sense when a car is near, and turn on the camera, which processes the image taken(of the
vehicle) and sends an email to the client with the taken image of the car, a text with the license plate number, and a cropped image of the license plate. 
        <-      
Material:
Using Raspberry PI, PI-Camera(or any good quality camera), Python, a good old breadbord, an Ultra-sonic sensor, and a group of jumper wires and resistors.                
                  
Please refer to me if there are any questions regarding the project,
